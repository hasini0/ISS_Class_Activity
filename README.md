def is_narc(n) and def print_narcis_numbers(start end) were missing colons (:) at the end.

num_str == str(n) and num_digits == len(num_str) used == (comparison) instead of = (assignment
sum(int(digit) * num_digits for digit in num_str) used * (multiplication) instead of ** (exponentiation).
print_narcis_numbers was defined, but the call at the end used print_narc_numbers.
he if statement in print_narc_numbers called is_narcissistic(num), but the function is named is_narc.
The for loop and if statement were missing colons (:) at the end.
The docstring for is_narc said "Check if a number is narc," which is unclear.
